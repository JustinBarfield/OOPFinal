trying to organize my thoughts and what needs to get done 

the resturaunt is initialized in a 2d array of tables of varying size
the reservations are sorted by day, by time, by party size in ReservationRecord
should each reservation be set for a duration? to make "timing" easier?
the reservations are sent to the host to seat the tables in the sorted order
need to make an algorithm to figure out what tables to seat and where
a server and busser are set to the table to take the order
the order is sent to the cook
the order is returned to the table? not sure what to do with a food order
when party is done, after duration? busser does job and clears table
